TO RUN THE TABLESTUCK BOT, YOU FIRST NEED TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS --

1- Download and install Node.js

  When the Node.js installation asks if you want to install tools necessary to compile native modules, please make sure that the box is checked!
  If you don't do this, you will need to install python and Visual Studio c++ manually.

2- Once Node.js is installed, open the command terminal in this folder and type the following --
  npm install discord.js
  npm install enmap

3- Create a text file called auth.json and paste the following into it --
  {
    "token": "YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN HERE",
    "prefix": ">",
    "admin": "YOUR DISCORD ID HERE"
  }

  Replace the token and admin sections with your own information to connect this program to your own discord bot.

4- Open the file "run.bat" to start the bot

--this code is not the finished version of the bot and will continue to be updated regularly on github--
